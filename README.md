🦺 AI–IoT Based Smart Helmet for Construction Workers
📌 Overview

The AI–IoT Based Smart Helmet is an intelligent safety system designed to enhance the protection of construction workers by continuously monitoring environmental conditions and worker health. By combining IoT sensors with AI-based decision making, the helmet helps prevent accidents, detects hazardous situations, and enables real-time alerts.

🎯 Objectives

Improve worker safety at construction sites

Detect unsafe working conditions in real time

Reduce accidents through early warnings

Enable remote monitoring for supervisors

🚀 Features

🔥 Gas Detection – Identifies harmful gases on site

🌡️ Temperature Monitoring – Detects abnormal heat conditions

💓 Health Monitoring – Tracks worker vitals (heart rate, motion)

🚧 Fall Detection – Alerts in case of accidents or sudden falls
