## 3. Functional modules & engineering details

### 3.1 Fatigue / Drowsiness Detection (Vision + IMU)

*Goal:* Detect signs of drowsiness: prolonged eye closure, yawning, head nodding/tilting, slow blink rate, micro-sleeps.

*Sensors used:* Front-facing camera (RGB or IR for low light), IMU (3-axis accelerometer + gyroscope).

*Algorithm options:*

* *Vision pipeline (primary):*

  * Face detection (e.g., Haar cascades, SSD, or lightweight mobile net)
  * Facial landmark detection (eyes, mouth, head pose) — e.g., 68-landmark shape predictor
  * Compute Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to detect eye closure events
  * Yawn detection via mouth aspect ratio or lip separation over consecutive frames
  * Blink frequency / PERCLOS (percentage of eyelid closure over time)
  * Head pose estimation (roll/pitch/yaw) from landmarks to detect nodding
  * Combine features with a short-term sliding window (e.g., 30 s window) and thresholding or a small classifier (SVM / lightweight CNN / LSTM) for temporal patterns.

* *IMU-based corroboration:*

  * Detect head nodding (pitch angle spike) using gyroscope/accelerometer.
  * If vision indicates partial occlusion or poor lighting, rely more on IMU.

*Model choices & deployment:*

* Train small on-device network (MobileNetV2 backbone + classifier) or use classical computer-vision heuristics when compute limited.
* For edge devices, use TensorFlow Lite or ONNX Runtime (Micro) for deployment.
* Tradeoffs: Vision gives highest accuracy; IMU helps disambiguate and reduces false positives.

*Output & actions:*

* Immediate local alert: vibration + buzzer
* Supervisor alert: send event to cloud (worker ID, timestamp, severity)
* Log with video/frames (optional, privacy tradeoff)

*Metrics to measure:* detection latency, sensitivity to true drowsiness events (recall), false alarm rate (precision), power consumption, CPU usage.

---

### 3.2 Alcohol Detection

*Sensor:* MQ-3 / semiconductor alcohol sensor, optionally combined with breath capture funnel or skin-VOC sensors.

*Engineering notes:*

* MQ-3 is cheap but noisy and sensitive to ethanol vapor concentration, requires calibration.
* Place sensor where it can detect breath/ambient ethanol (inside helmet near chin or in front of mouth area).
* Use warm-up period (seconds to minutes) and temperature compensation.
* Implement smoothing filter and moving average to avoid spurious spikes.

*Logic:*

* Threshold-based detection: calibrate empirically to correspond to BAC levels (note: MQ-3 cannot directly measure BAC; only indicates ethanol presence).
* If indicator > threshold → disable equipment access (RFID lock), send alert with timestamp, tag worker ID.

*Considerations:*

* False positives possible (alcohol in environment, sanitizers). Add secondary confirmation (repeat measures or cross-check with supervisor).
* Legal/ethical: store event logs securely and comply with workplace policies.

---

### 3.3 Face / Identity Authentication & Attendance

*Hardware:* camera or RFID/NFC.

*Approach:*

* Lightweight face recognition using embeddings (FaceNet, MobileFaceNet) and cosine similarity with stored embeddings.
* For low-power/quick verification, use RFID for attendance and face solely for verification.
* Enroll each worker: capture multiple images at varied angles/lighting.

*Security & privacy:*

* Store embeddings on the cloud or on gateway with encryption.
* Use 1:many matching for attendance at gates and 1:1 for controlled access.

*Failure cases:*

* Poor light -> fallback to RFID/NFC tag
* Mask-wearing scenarios -> use RFID or masked-face models.

---

### 3.4 Helmet Removal Detection

*Sensors:* Pressure/contact sensor, proximity switch, or capacitive strap sensor.

*Logic:*

* When contact sensor indicates helmet is not strapped or pressure = 0 for > X seconds during work hours -> log event.
* Timer starts; if not corrected within threshold (e.g., 2 minutes) -> alert and supervisor notification.
* If a hazardous zone entry requires helmet, cross-check geofence + helmet worn status before allowing access.

---

### 3.5 Noise Level Monitoring

*Sensor:* Sound level meter (microphone + ADC, or dedicated digital sound level sensor).

*Metric:* Measure dB(A) equivalent; if exposure > 85 dB (OSHA typical threshold) over time -> warn. Implement cumulative exposure calculation (time-weighted).

*Actions:* On threshold breach, local alert + supervisor notification + log for occupational safety report.

---

### 3.6 Helmets-to-Helmets Communication (Mesh)

*Options:* LoRa mesh, ESP-NOW, ZigBee, BLE Mesh.

*Design:*

* Form local mesh for low-latency peer-to-peer alerts (accident nearby).
* Use LoRa for long-range low-bandwidth site coverage; ESP-NOW for quick MAC-based comms.
* Implement a minimal message format (JSON or binary) with worker ID, event type, timestamp, location (if available), signal strength.
* Priority queue for emergency messages; dedicate a special channel for life-threatening alerts.

*Resilience:*

* Store-and-forward via nearest gateway if internet unavailable.
* Acknowledge critical messages to avoid loss.

---

### 3.7 Edge & Cloud Data Flow

*Protocol:* MQTT (lightweight) or HTTPS.

*Data types:*

* Telemetry (timestamped sensor readings)
* Events (drowsiness, alcohol, helmet removal)
* Identity logs (attendance)
* Health graphs (noise exposure)

*Edge processing:*

* Preprocess and filter events on helmet/gateway to reduce bandwidth.
* Only send summaries or critical frames to cloud.

*Cloud components:*

* MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto, AWS IoT Core)
* Time-series DB (InfluxDB, Timescale) for telemetry
* Relational DB (Postgres) for users, events, metadata
* Object store (S3) for video frames (if used)
* Analytics & dashboard (Grafana or custom React dashboard) for supervisors

---

## 4. Data & Machine Learning

### 4.1 Data required

* *Vision*: video of workers performing normal and drowsy behaviours (open, half-closed, closed eyes; yawns; nodding). Balanced across lighting, skin tones, head orientation, helmet on/off.
* *IMU*: labeled accelerometer/gyro sequences for nodding, normal movement.
* *Alcohol sensor*: controlled test readings with known ethanol vapor exposures (careful lab setup).
* *Noise*: labeled environmental audio clips & dB measurements.
* *Identity*: multiple face images per worker for enrollment.

### 4.2 Annotation

* Frame-level labels: eye open/closed, yawning, head pose, event start/end.
* Sequence labels for drowsiness episodes.
* Ensure consistent timestamping across sensors.

### 4.3 Model design choices

* *Fatigue:* Hybrid heuristics + small CNN + temporal model (1D CNN or LSTM) to capture blink patterns vs transient closures.
* *Face recognition:* MobileFaceNet or FaceNet embeddings compressed to 128-d vectors; k-NN or cosine thresholding.
* *IMU classification:* simple LSTM or 1D-CNN for nod detection.

### 4.4 Training & augmentation

* Augment visual data with brightness/contrast, rotation, occlusion, blur.
* For temporal models, use sliding windows and overlap to increase samples.
* Cross-validation to check generalization across workers and sites.

### 4.5 On-device inference

* Convert models to TensorFlow Lite (quantize to int8 if required) to run on ESP32-CAM (very limited) or Raspberry Pi. For Jetson Nano, use TensorRT for speed.
* Aim for inference time < 200–300 ms for real-time responsiveness.

### 4.6 Performance metrics

* *Classification:* accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix.
* *Temporal detection:* event detection rate, time-to-detection, false positive per hour/day.
* *System:* latency, battery life, CPU & memory utilization.

---

## 7. System logic & event flows

### Example: Drowsiness event flow

1. Camera captures frame → face and landmarks detected → compute EAR.
2. If EAR < threshold for consecutive frames (e.g., 3 sec), increment drowsiness counter.
3. IMU corroborates head nod (if present).
4. If counter exceeds event threshold → trigger local alert (vibrate + buzzer).
5. Helmet publishes event to MQTT topic: {worker_id, event: drowsiness, severity, timestamp, location}
6. Gateway receives → supervisor dashboard displays alert + stores event.
7. If critical (repeated events) → escalate (SMS to site manager).

### Example: Alcohol detection flow

1. MQ-3 sensor reading crosses set threshold.
2. Validate with repeated measure (two readings within 30 sec).
3. If persistent, send alcohol_detected event to gateway.
4. Optionally lock access gate using RFID integration and send supervisor alert.

---

## 8. Safety, privacy & ethics

*Privacy considerations:*

* Face images are sensitive. Use embeddings (not raw images) where possible.
* Encrypt data at rest and in transit (TLS for MQTT, AES for stored logs).
* Minimize video storage — store only encrypted short clips for incidents, or only store derived features.
* Define retention policies: delete or anonymize logs after a defined period unless necessary for legal reasons.

*Ethics & policy:*

* Obtain worker consent for monitoring and clearly define usage policies.
* Provide appeal/verification process if an incident is logged (false positives).
* Avoid punitive automatic actions that could endanger workers (e.g., instantly firing).
* Ensure alcohol detection policies align with labor laws and company agreements.

*Safety:*

* Reliably avoid false negatives on critical events.
* Provide local alarms even if network down.
* Fail-safe: if system error occurs, do not block emergency actions.

---

## 9. Testing & validation

*Unit & Integration tests:*

* Sensor calibration tests, driver tests.
* Simulated events (video clips, IMU sequences) for model verification.
* Network resilience testing (simulate gateway down, packet loss).

*Field trials:*

* Short pilot at a controlled site.
* Logging ground truth using supervisor annotations.
* Compare system detections to human observations; compute recall/precision.

*Evaluation metrics to track:*

* Drowsiness detection: True Positive Rate (recall), False Positive Rate (per day), latency.
* Alcohol detection: True/False positives per controlled samples.
* System uptime & battery life across shifts.
* Communication success rate (messages delivered / sent).

---

## 10. Deployment & maintenance

*Pilot → Rollout steps:*

1. Prototype on a few helmets; lab testing.
2. Controlled pilot at one site for 2–4 weeks; collect real data.
3. Retrain/improve models using site data (domain adaptation).
4. Incrementally roll out across site with training for workers and supervisors.
5. Continuous monitoring & OTA model updates.

*Maintenance:*

* Battery replacement plan, sensor recalibration schedule.
* Model update frequency (monthly/quarterly depending on data drift).
* Establish SLA for system health alerts (gateway down, device offline).

---

## 11. Security considerations

* Mutual TLS for device-cloud comms (certificate-based auth).
* Device identity with unique keys; rotate keys periodically.
* Secure boot for device (prevent tampering).
* Access control for dashboard (RBAC: worker, supervisor, admin).
* Audit logs for sensitive events and access.

---

## 12. Cost & timeline (example roadmap)

*Rough timeline (for a small team, 3–4 members):*

* Week 1–2: Requirements, BOM, initial hardware selection, small proof-of-concept (camera + EAR).
* Week 3–6: Firmware & basic cloud pipeline (MQTT + DB + dashboard skeleton).
* Week 6–10: ML model training & on-device deployment (TFLite), IMU integration.

*Estimated development cost (prototype stage):*

* Hardware (per device): ₹4k–₹12k (depending on MCU choice)
* Cloud hosting (initial): small (₹1–3k/month) for prototype; scales with scale.
* Development labor: varies (student project vs company).

---

## 17. Common pitfalls & how to avoid them

* *False alarms* — Tune thresholds; use multi-sensor corroboration (vision+IMU).
* *Poor lighting* — Use IR camera or rely on IMU when vision fails.
* *Privacy pushback* — Use embeddings, minimize raw video storage, explicit consent.
* *Sensor drift (MQ-3)* — Regular calibration and temperature compensation.
* *Battery life issues* — Duty cycle camera (capture at lower fps), perform inference at intervals, use low-power radios for telemetry.
* *Network outage* — Local mesh communications and local alerts must still work offline.

---

## 18. Extensions & future work

* Multi-modal health monitoring (heart-rate via PPG, SpO2) for more robust fatigue detection.
* Predictive analytics: predict periods of higher risk for particular workers using historical data.
* Integrate with site machinery for automatic shutdown in case of emergency.
* Integrate computer vision for site hazard detection (falling objects, open trenches).
* Use anonymized aggregated data to optimize shift schedules to reduce fatigue.
